Student Planner can:

* Manage their contacts
* Manage their tasks

* Manage their events

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *findaddress command and findphone command*
** What it does: Allows the user to search thorugh the user's contacts by their address and phone number.
** Justification: Searching for contacts by name may not be enough for a user. A user might need to find persons in a certain area or check who is the owner of the missing phone call. These features make the product more user friendly and provide the user with functionality.
** Highlights: The implemenation was challenging since it requiered a deep understanding of how the commands are related to parsers and how they are connected to the logic of the program and also knowledge of predicates. Adding these commands also involved adding parser and predicate classes.

* *Minor enhancement*: Changed find command to findname command in order to be consistent with the naming of the other find commands.
