---

== Overview

Student Planner is a all-in-one desktop manager application that allows students to manage their contacts, tasks, events and expenses. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *Events management*
** What it does: Allows the user to manage their events.
** Justification: This feature allows the user to keep track of new and existing events. Being a student with a busy schedule, he/she may not be able to keep track of all of his/her events, hence this feature will
help them access their event schedule with just a few commands.
